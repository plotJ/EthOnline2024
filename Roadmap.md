# VoteChain Nexus Development Roadmap

## 1. Set up the development environment
- Initialize a new Node.js project
- Install necessary dependencies: ethers.js, @hashgraph/sdk, 
- Set up a .env file for storing sensitive information

## 2. Implement wallet connection
- Add functionality to the "Connect Wallet" button
- Use ethers.js to handle wallet connection
- Store the connected address in app state
- Update UI to show connected/disconnected state

## 3. Create and deploy the Voting smart contract
- Begin writing the Voting contract in Solidity, defining the structure and variables
- Develop functions for creating ballots, including input validation and event emission
- Implement functions for casting votes, including vote counting and result tracking
- Create functions for retrieving results, including data formatting and accessibility
- Set up Hardhat to compile and deploy the contract to Hedera's testnet
- Write scripts to automate deployment and testing
- Save the deployed contract address and ABI for future use

## 4. Integrate Sign Protocol for attestations
Set up Sign Protocol SDK in your project
Design and create a schema for voter attestations
Implement function to generate voter attestations when a wallet connects
Create function to verify attestations before allowing votes
Use Sign Protocol's indexing service to query and validate attestations

## 5. Set up Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)
- Initialize Hedera SDK in your project
- Create a topic for your voting application using HCS
- Implement functions to submit messages (votes) to the HCS topic
- Create a service to listen for and process HCS messages

## 6. Connect front-end to smart contract and Sign Protocol
Use ethers.js to create a contract instance
Implement functions to call contract methods (createBallot, castVote, getResults)
Create functions to interact with Sign Protocol (createAttestation, getAttestation)
Update the UI to display active ballots from the contract
Enable the "Vote Now" button when a wallet is connected and attestation is verified

## 7. Implement voting functionality with Sign Protocol integration
Create a modal or form for casting votes
Verify voter attestation using Sign Protocol before allowing vote submission
Send transactions to the smart contract when a user votes
Create an attestation for each vote cast using Sign Protocol
Record each vote on HCS after it's accepted by the smart contract and attested

## Develop results retrieval and display with attestation verification
Create functions to fetch voting results from the smart contract
Implement real-time updates using HCS messages
Verify vote attestations using Sign Protocol's indexing service
Update the Results table in the UI with live, verified data

## 9. Error handling and user feedback
- Implement error catching for all blockchain interactions
- Create user-friendly error messages and success notifications
- Add loading states for blockchain transactions

## 10. Testing and refinement
- Test all functions thoroughly: wallet connection, attestation, voting, results retrieval
- Ensure proper handling of edge cases
- Refine UI/UX based on testing results

## 11. Final touches
- Implement any missing features from the original design
- Optimize performance, especially for real-time updates
- Ensure responsive design works correctly on various devices

## 12. Documentation
- Write clear instructions for using the dApp
- Document the smart contract functions and HCS topic usage
- Prepare a project submission detailing the technologies used and challenges overcome
